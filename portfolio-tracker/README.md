# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#### Portfolio Tracker

1. user connects wallet and it shows balance of eth
2. Write tests with mocks to ensure it is accurate
   2a. use blockchain queries for main app and test with etherscan api?
3. will show other token balances eventually
4. will show balance across networks
